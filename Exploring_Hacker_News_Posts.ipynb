    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to break into Hacker News website, and deal with the content of posts( also knows as \"stories\") submitted by users . [Hacker News][1] is  a site started by the startup incubator **Y Combinator**, where user-submitted stories are voted and commented upon, simalar to reddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main objective is to analyze posts whose titles begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`, and answer the following questions :\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?\n",
    "* Do these posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Here are a couple examples :\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ask HN: how to improve my personal website?\n",
    "Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, users submit `Show HN` posts to show a project, a product, or just something interesting. Below are a couple of examples:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Show HN: Wio Link ESP8266 Based Web of things Hardware Development Platform\n",
    "Show HN: Something pointless I made\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin our journey by look into the `hacker_news.csv` available [here][2]. We will perform a quick view of the data set to understand a little bit about the data stored in. Then, we will convert the csv file to a list of lists.\n",
